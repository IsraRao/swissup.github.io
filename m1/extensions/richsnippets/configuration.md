We recommend to choose “JSON Format” for invisible block with your store snippets. This type is simplified and clear to use. In case you want to show a visible block with snippets both in search results and on product page, you'd better to select Microdata type.

### Social links and cards

Social links snippets will help you to boost click-through rate for your shared URLs, get more traffic from social networks and increase a social media followers base. We do recommend you to implement rich snippets for social media.

-	`Select **Yes** if you want to enable a **Twitter card snippet**. Twitter Cards improve a media experience to Tweets that link to your site content. After adding a snippet, users who Tweet your products will have a “card” added to their Tweet that will be visible to all of their followers.
